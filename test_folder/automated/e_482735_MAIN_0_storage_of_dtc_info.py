title:
    Storage of DTC information

purpose:
    To ensure that the amount of DTCs that shall be stored in long-term memory.

description:
    The ECU shall store supported DTC information in the long-term memory.

    DTC information:
     * Status bits
     * Snapshot data
     * Status indicators (SI)
     * Operation cycle counters (OCC)
     * Time stamps

details:
    Look for DTC that has the DTC status bit "confirmed" set. If it is set,
    then we can be certain that the snapshot is in long-term memory. Verify
    then that it has, dtc status bits, snapshot data, operation cycle counters,
    and time stamps.

    The test is an existence test making sure that at lease one DTC has been
    stored in the long-term memory.
