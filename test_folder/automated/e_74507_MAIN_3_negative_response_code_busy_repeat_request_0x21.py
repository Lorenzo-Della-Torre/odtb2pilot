title: Negative response code busyRepeatRequest (0x21)
purpose: >
    Standardise the negative response codes that an ECU may send to make it easier to understand
    why a ECU rejects a diagnostic service request.

description: >
    Rationale: The ECU shall always be ready to receive diagnostic request within its normal
    operation cycle. Negative response code busyRepeatRequest (0x21) will create disturbance in
    the manufacturing and aftersales process and is not generally allowed to be used by the ECU.

    Req: The negative response code busyRepeatRequest (0x21) sent by negative responses on
    diagnostic services requests is not allowed unless otherwise is specified by this document.

details: >
    Verify negative response code busyRepeatRequest(0x21).
