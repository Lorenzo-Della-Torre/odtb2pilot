version: 1
title: Read out Security Event records
purpose: >
    Define how to read log using a diagnostic client. A typical use-case is to read the
    information while ECU application is running, i.e. without forcing the vehicle into
    programming session (convenience).

description: >
    It shall be possible to read all Security Event types via the diagnostic protocol,
    using the service ReadDataByIdentifier. Event types reported in programmingSession
    shall also be available to read in non-programmingSession.

    A unique DID shall be applied for each type.

details: >
    From an excel sheet attached to the Vira story the different events are obtained.
    Each of the events has a DID connected to it, these DIDs are read to verify that

    "It shall be possible to read all Security Event types via the diagnostic protocol,
    using the service ReadDataByIdentifier."

    A check is also done to make sure that the sizes of the DIDs are correct.
    This increases the likelyhood that the DID is correct.
