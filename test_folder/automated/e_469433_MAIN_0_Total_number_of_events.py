title: Total number of events
purpose: >
    Define content of a security event header.

description: >
    The ECU record the total number of events reported for each event type
    (TotalNumberOfReportedEvents). For some event types, it's important
    to be able to distinguish between successful- and rejected attempts.
    Hence, the Security Event Header could optionally include a second counter.

    For each event type, one of the two following Security Event Header counter
    structures shall be used;

        Security Event Header type 1, including one single counter of all reported
        events (TotalNumberOfReportedEvents).

        Security Event Header type 2, including two counters;
        the first counter keep track of the successful attempts (TotalNumberOfSuccessfulEvents)
        and the second attempt counts the number of rejected attempts
        (TotalNumberOfRejectedEvents). This is to be applied when successful and
        rejected attempts are reported and could be separated

    Example.
    Event Type is for Software Update. Security Event Header Type 2 is used, as it is
    relevant to store history about both successful and failed events.
        Counter 1: Counts the number of successful software updates.
        Counter 2: Counts the number of rejected (but started) software updates.

details: >
    Read Security log event DID D046 and record the total number of
    successful and rejected events.
    Unlock the Security Access and check the Security Access is successful by
    incrementing successful event 1.
    Send invalid security access key to get the rejected software update(events)
    and check the rejected event count is increased by 1 and software update is rejected.
