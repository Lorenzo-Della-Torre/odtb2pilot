title: Security Event Header
purpose: >
    Define the structure of the Security Event Header.

description: >
    Every security event shall contain a Security Event Header, including
    â€¢ TotalNumberOfReportedEvents: The total number of reported events,
    for each individual event type.

    Figure SecurityEvent and SecurityEventHeader

    A typical read out will contain a simple header followed by all records (events).
    Notes.
    (i) If the reserved log data is not full, the TotalNumberOfReportedEvents will be identical
    to the number of stored records for a specific event type.
    (ii) A strategy for counter (TotalNumberOfReportedEvents) overflow is defined elsewhere in
    this document.
    (iii) See other requirements, defining two types of security event header.


details:
    This requirement is tested by reading the relevant DIDs. Using info in the sddb file
    it is possible to get the part of the DIDs data that belong to "TotalNumberOfReportedEvents".

    An addition to this test should be to check that the value for TotalNumberOfReportedEvents
    is correct. It could probably be done by checking the size of did_info_dics.

    There are two types of security event headers. The test accepts both.
