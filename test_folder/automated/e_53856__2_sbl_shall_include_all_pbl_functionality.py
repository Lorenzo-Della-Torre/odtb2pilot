title: : The SBL shall include all PBL functionality
purpose: >
    To simplify the bootloader implementation, to have the possibility to do a workaround
    if an error has occurred in the PBL and that no calls are necessary from the SBL to the PBL.

description: >
    The SBL shall include the complete PBL functionality.

details: >
    Verify all of the PBL services are included in SBL services
    Steps:
        1. Get all PBL and SBL services from sddb services dictionary
        2. Compare and verify all of the PBL services are included in SBL services
