title: overwrite strategy

purpose: >
    to reduce the risk of data being erased.

description: >
    The log data must be protected from being erased.
    The default overwrite strategy to be applied is First-In-First-Out (FIFO),
    i.e. time-based. If there is some critical event that shall be excluded from
    this policy, this must be explicitly specified elsewhere.
    FIFO shall apply for every type, meaning that an event categorized as one type
    shall not overwrite an older event for a second type. For an event type where
    half of the events are dedicated for successful- and the other half for rejected
    attempts, there will be two separate FIFO lists

details: >
    The ECU must record the total number of events reported for
    each event type (TotalNumberOfReportedEvents). For some event types,
    it's important to be able to distinguish between successful- and rejected attempts.
    Hence, the Security Event Header could optionally include a second counter.
    For each event type, one of the two following Security Event Header counter
    structures shall be used; Security Event Header type 1,
    including one single counter of all reported events (TotalNumberOfReportedEvents).
    Security Event Header type 2, including two counters; the first counter keep track of
    the successful attempts (TotalNumberOfSuccessfulEvents) and the second attempt
    counts the number of rejected attempts (TotalNumberOfRejectedEvents).
    This is to be applied when successful and rejected attempts are reported and could be
    separated. Security Event Header type 2 shall be applied when the event type
    contains both successful and rejected events, so for checking that overwrite of events
    TotalNumberOfSuccessfulEvents and TotalNumberOfRejectedEvents are made 16 each as the
    FIFO is Full now one more Event is generated to check it shall not overwritten
    on older event for a second type of event.
