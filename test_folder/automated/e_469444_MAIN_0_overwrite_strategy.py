title: Overwrite strategy
purpose: >
    To reduce the risk of data being erased

description: >
    The log data must be protected from being erased.
    The default overwrite strategy to be applied is First-In-First-Out (FIFO),
    i.e. time-based. If there is some critical event that shall be excluded from
    this policy, this must be explicitly specified elsewhere.
    FIFO shall apply for every type, meaning that an event categorized as one type
    shall not overwrite an older event for a second type. For an event type where
    half of the events are dedicated for successful- and the other half for rejected
    attempts, there will be two separate FIFO lists
