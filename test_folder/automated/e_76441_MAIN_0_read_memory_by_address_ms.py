description:
    The ECU shall support the service readMemoryByAddress with the data
    parameter memorySize in all sessions where the ECU supports the service
    readMemoryByAddress. The implementer shall define the values of the
    memorySize.

    Tested implicitly by REQPROD 76173
    This testcase has been tested by REQPROD 76173 where 10 bytes of data is
    set as the memorySize. The data is being read from the memory address
    0x70000000 in each session using the following payload: 0x232470000000000A.
    The last 0x0A corresponds to the 10 bytes of data that is requested.
