title: SecOC - Action on message failures

purpose: >
    To define what action to take when messages are failed due to SecOC

description: >
    When ECU fails to receive signals due to SecOC verification failures, Application
    software shall define and handle failure actions. Few possible actions can be:
    1. Use fail safe data values/actions
    2. Disable functions
    3. Temporarily accept failed signal data under specified range and conditions
    4. Report failures to security log
    5. Take no action

    If the application using SecOC requires hard start-up timing, meaning that the function
    must be available prior to the time is synched or available, the ECU need to implement special
    handling during those conditions. Such handling shall be analyzed to ensure that no
    vulnerabilities are introduced, that results in bypassing SecOC protection mechanism.

    Also, application functions shall be designed fault tolerant for SecOC verification failures
    in some ECU operating conditions such as low voltage conditions, power fluctuations, harsh
    environments, communication link disabled (E.g. Busoff in CAN), too many invalid messages
    received (Spoofing or replay attacks) etc. to ensure system behavior is never compromised.
