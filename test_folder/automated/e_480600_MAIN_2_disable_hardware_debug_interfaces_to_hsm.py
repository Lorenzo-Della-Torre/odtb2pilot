title: Disable Hardware Debug Interfaces to HSM

purpose: >
    Prevent hardware debug interfaces to be used by an attacker to analyze, control and modify
    the hardware security modules

description: >
    Only applicable for ECUs with Hardware Security Modules (HSM).

    Hardware debug interface to a Hardware Security Module shall by default be
    permanently disabled.

    Note:
    A Hardware Security Module is a general term used to realize hardware security and is
    usually a dedicated hardware or a logically isolated secure environment, handling
    cryptographic keys and sensitive security operations. Commonly implemented and referred
    as HSM/SHE/TPM/TEE or any other vendor specific secure environments.

details: >
    Verify hardware debug interface security with boot loader did 'F1FD' in both programming
    and extended session.
    Steps-
        1. Verify negative response in programming session without security access
        2. Verify positive response in programming session with security access
        3. Verify negative response in extended session without security access
        4. Verify negative response in extended session with security access
