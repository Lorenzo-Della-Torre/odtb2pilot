title: ECU ability to receive requests
purpose: >
    Define a time the ECU is allowed to be unavailable in regards of diagnostic communication
    when powering up and the time shall be short enough to not be a problem for manufacturing
    and aftersales.

description: >
    The ECU shall all the time be able to receive diagnostic service requests and send a response
    (positive or negative) on the requests as long as the ECU is within an operation cycle.

details: >
    Verify response for all sessions(Default, Extended and Programming) after ECU reset within
    operation cycle.
