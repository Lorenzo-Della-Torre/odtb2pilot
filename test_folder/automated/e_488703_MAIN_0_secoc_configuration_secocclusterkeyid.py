title: SecOC configuration - SecOCClusterKeyID.

purpose: >
    To allow the possibility to configure the KeyID for each PDU.

description: >
    This configuration is applicable if multiple SecOC keys are used on the same ECU.
    It can be skipped in case only one SecOC key is used on the ECU.

    It shall be possible to configure which SecOC Cluster Key Identifier shall be used for
    each PDU by configuring the parameter SecOCClusterKeyID.

    Note: SecOCClusterKeyID here is OEM configuration to uniquely identify key for each
    SecOC cluster. ECUs shall internally define how this value can be mapped to actual
    key slot ID in the storage

details: >
    Not applicable because we only have one cluster and one key.
