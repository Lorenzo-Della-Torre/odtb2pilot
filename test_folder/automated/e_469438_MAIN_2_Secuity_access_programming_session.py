reqprod: 469438
version: 2
title: Security Access Programming session
purpose: >
    Define general event types that are applicable for many ECUs. If there are other requirements
    that limits the possibility to log data, e.g. if the ECU is in a state where it lacks
    capabilities to write to non-volatile memory, the security audit log shall not override those
    requirements. Such an example might be bootloaders that lack write/erase non-volatile memory
    instructions.

description: >
    The ECU shall implement event type "Security Access ProgrammingSession" data record with
    identifier 0xD046. The event type is for diagnostic service SecurityAccess when the ECU is
    running in ProgrammingSession.

    The structure as defined in "REQPROD 469437 : Event Type - Security Access Application" shall
    be applied, but the Time per event record shall be removed from the structure as many ECUs have
    no knowledge of the time (or internal counter that is always incrementing and never resets) in
    this state:

    Event Header: SecurityEventHeaderType 2. Size 32+32 bits.
    Event Records:
    EventCode: See "Table - Security Access Application Event Code" defined in "REQPROD 469437 :
    Event Type - Security Access Application". Size 8 bits.
    AdditionalEventData: Byte value of subfunction requestSeed ("security access level"). Size 8
    bits.

    Access Control: Option (3) as defined in "REQPROD 469450 : Security Audit Log - Access Control"
    shall be applied.

details: >
