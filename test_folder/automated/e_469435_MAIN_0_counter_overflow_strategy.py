title: Counter overflow strategy
purpose:
    Define the strategy if the counter(s) defined in the SecurityEventHeader overflows.
    By defining a counter of a appropriate length, the risk of counter overflow between
    two readouts is reduced.

description:
    The counters defined in the SecurityEvent Header shall have a length of at least 4 bytes.
    Counter overflow is accepted but there shall be no possibility to reset the counters.

details:
    Verify counter overflow strategy
    Steps:
        1. Read security log event DID 'D046'
        2. Set ECU in programming session and verify active diagnostic session
        3. Security access to ECU in programming session
        4. Set ECU to default session and read security log event DID 'D046'
        5. Security access to ECU in programming session with invalid key
        6. ECU reset
        7. Set ECU to default session and read security log event DID 'D046'
