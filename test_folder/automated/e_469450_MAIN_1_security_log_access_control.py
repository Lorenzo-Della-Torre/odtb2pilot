version: 1
title: Security Log - Access Control
purpose:
    To prevent unauthorized access to the log, meaning that sensitive information
    about internal processes might be obtained.

description:
    Only authorized parties shall be able to view the log data and it must be accessible
    to authorized users when needed, to not reveal e.g. information about the system design
    that might be misused. One of following options shall be applied based on information stored:
    (1) The log data is encrypted according to method agreed with OEM (specified elsewhere).
    (2) The log data is read (readDataByIdentifier service) protected by using diagnostic service
    securityAccess. Security Access level 0x19 shall be used.
    (3) The log data is not protected with respect to access control. This alternative
    must be used with a motivation/assessment (e.g. the information does not reveal any
    sensitive information).

details:
    Implicitly tested script
    Tested implicitly by REQPROD 469434 because the log data is not protected with respect
    to access control.
