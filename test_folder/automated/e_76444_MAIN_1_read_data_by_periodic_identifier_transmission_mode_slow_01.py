title: ReadDataByPeriodicIdentifier (2A) - transmissionMode slow (01)
purpose: >
    Define the transmissionMode slow

description: >
    The ECU may support the service readDataByPeriodicIdentifier with the data parameter
    transmissionMode slow in all sessions where the ECU supports the service
    readDataByPeriodicIdentifier. The implementer defines the value of the transmission rate
    in the transmissionMode slow.

details: >
    Implicitly tested script
    Tested implicitly by REQPROD 76442 because the transmissionMode slow (0x01) parameter has
    already verified in the requirement 76442
