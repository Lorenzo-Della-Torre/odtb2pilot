title: Authentication Data - Algorithm
purpose: >
    Define the algorithm to be used to calculate the Authentication Data.

description: >
    The "NIST Special Publication 800-38B Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation;
    The CMAC Mode for Authentication" shall by default be used to calculate the Authentication Data.
    The underlying block cipher shall be AES-128 (Advanced Encryption Standard FIPS PUB 197),
    where 128 bits is the minimum key length.
    Notes.
    (i) To reduce the required memory space, the CMAC might need to be truncated
    but is shall always be at least be 4 bytes (most significant bytes).
    (ii) Other methods like hash-based HMAC construction according to [FIPS Publ 198-1]
    as well as "Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and
    GMAC, NIST Special Publication 800-38D" can be used upon agreement with Volvo or
    when explicitly required for a specific event type (based on data structure and
    key format defined by Volvo).GCM provides authenticated encryption.

details:
    Calculate authentication data using Crypto AES-128 algorithm and verify with security
    log authentication data.
    Steps-
        1. Read security log
        2. Exclude authentication data from security log
        3. Calculate CMAC and compare with security log authentication data
