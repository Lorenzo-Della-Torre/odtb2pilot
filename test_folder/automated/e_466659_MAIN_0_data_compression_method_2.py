title: Data Compression Method 2
purpose: >
    State the compression method #2

description: >
    The data compression/decompression method #2 shall be LZMA.
    Note: Data_format_identifier for compression method #2 is specified in
    [VCC-UDS Services, REQPROD 459337]. LZMA SDK (version 18.01) and specification can be
    downloaded from http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html

details: >
    Implicitly tested script
    Tested implicitly by REQPROD 400425 because compression is done by VECS and if the
    decompression did not work in the ECU, SWDL would fail.
