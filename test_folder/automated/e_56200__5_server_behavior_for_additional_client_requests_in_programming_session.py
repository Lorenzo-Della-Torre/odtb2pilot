title: Server behavior for additional client requests in programming session
purpose: >
    If the server is processing a request and receives a request that is supposed to be
    placed in the receive queue and the receive queue is full, a predictable behavior is required.

description: >
    In programming session, if the server is processing a request and it receives a request that is
    supposed to be placed in the receive queue and the receive queue is full; the request just
    received shall be ignored.

    Note: This requirement applies regardless of the actual size of the receive queue.
    Example assuming minimum 1 queued request is required; If the server is processing a first
    request and queues a second request, and then a third request appears, the third request shall
    be ignored unless it can be queued as well.

details: >
    Send flash erase requests in queue for four times using thread just before downloading ESS
    software part and verify that ECU should not give any response for last DID request since
    request queue is full.
