title:
    ECU Serial Number data record

purpose:
    To enable readout of the unique ECU serial number.

description: >
    Rationale:

    The serial number is a vital part for any process that requires
    traceability of mounted specific ECUs down to a vehicle individual. E.g. of
    such processes are the aftersales SWDL process and situations where
    vehicles are to be recalled due to warranty reasons. In case of recalls,
    the supplier must have designed and implemented the serial number in such a
    way that it is possible to trace which individual vehicles that are
    affected by using the serial number in combination with a hardware number.

    The combination of serial and core assembly part number must be unique even
    in the case where the delivered components are manufactured in different
    plants or production lines.

    Example of serial number format (length and coding)
    12345678 -> 12 34 56 78
    123456 -> 00 12 34 56

    Req:
    A data record with identifier as specified in the table below shall be
    implemented exactly as defined in Carcom - Global Master Reference
    Database. It shall be designed so that each individual ECU will have a
    unique serial number per ECU Core Assembly Part Number, independent of
    manufacturing plant/line. The combination of the serial and Core assembly
    part number shall support the possibility to identify individual ECUs.

    Description: ECU Serial number data record
    Identifier: F18C

    Read/write access:
     * It shall be possible to read the data record by using the diagnostic
       service specified in Ref[LC : Volvo Car Corporation - UDS Services -
       Service 0x22 (ReadDataByIdentifier) Reqs].
     * It shall not be possible to write to the data record using any
       diagnostic service after the supplier manufacturing process.

    Format and length:
    The data record shall have 8 digits for the serial number, all coded in
    BCD. The data record shall have a fixed length of 4 bytes, be right
    justified with any unused digit(s) filled with 0.

    Origin:
    The serial number shall be created in the supplier manufacturing process.

    Supported sessions:
    The identifier shall be implemented in the following sessions:
     * Default session
     * Programming session (which includes both primary and secondary bootloader)
     * Extended Session


details:
    Retrieve the ECU serial number in all sessions including primary and
    secondary bootloader
