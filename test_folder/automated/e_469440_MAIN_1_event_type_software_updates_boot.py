reqprod: 469440
version: 0
title: Security Event Header
purpose: >
    Define general event types that are applicable for many ECUs.
    If there are other requirements that limits the possibility to log data, e.g. if the
    ECU is in a state where it lacks capabilities to write to non-volatile memory,
    the security audit log shall not override those requirements.
    Such an example might be bootloaders that lack write/erase non-volatile
    memory instructions (due to other requirements specified elsewhere).

description: >
    The ECU shall implement event type "Software Updates boot" data record with identifier 0xD048,
    i.e. for software download in ProgrammingSesssion. The trigger for a software update is
    started is a transition from 'no update of a "logical block" active' to 'update of logical
    block ongoing'. See "REQPROD 400894: Request Download - restrictions on number of addressed
    logical blocks" for transition conditions.

    Event Header: SecurityEventTypeHeader 2. Size 32+32 bits.
    Event Records:
    EventCode. As defined in "Table - Software Updates boot Event Code". Size 8 bits.
    AdditionalEventData:
    For successful updates: Software partnumber where the digits shall be BCD encoded and the
    3 characters (version suffix) shall be coded in ASCII, right justified with any unused
    digit filled with 0, in total 7 bytes. Any unused version suffix shall be filled with space,
    left justified. Example: "1234567<space><space>A" is represented (hex)
    as: "01 23 45 67 20 20 41", i.e. according to partnumber format requirements. Size 56 bits.
    If application partnumber location is not possible to derive in this session,
    the logical block number shall be used. When the logical block number is used,
    the unused bytes shall be set to zeroes, i.e. the first logical block is represented
    as 0x00000000000001. Size 56 bits.

    For failed attempts: The addressed logical block number, where value 0x01 is the first
    part checked in "Complete & Compatible" routine control response, 0x02 is the second and so on.
    Size 8 bits.

    Event Code    Event
    0x00    No History stored
    0x01    Software Download started but failed prior to CheckMemory (optional, see note)
    0x02    Software Download started but failed at CheckMemory

    0x80    Software Download started and successfully completed at CheckMemory
    Table - Software Updates boot Event Code

    Access Control: Option (3) as defined in "REQPROD 469450 : Security Audit Log - Access Control"
    shall be applied.

    Design considerations: If partnumber is part of log data, the design must ensure that a change
    of partnumber allocation does not require a bootloader update.

    Note.
    If EventCode 0x01 is supported, it shall be applied for all conditions that results in a
    transition from 'update of logical block ongoing' to any other state, except when the
    state transition is triggered by a successful CheckMemory.



details:
    The did is read from the ECU. It is verified that the DID is read and that the sddb
    contains header, event code and additional data.

    Script needs to be updated to fully cover requirement.
    More verification of the log content is needed. One would need to trigger several events
    to make sure the logs are correct. Right now only some smaller verifications are made
    of the content.
