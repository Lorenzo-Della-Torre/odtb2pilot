title: N_Cs Performance requirement in non-programming session
purpose: >
    The time spent waiting shall be minimized and especially for N_Cs since N_Cs wait time is
    the factor that affects the transfer rates the most. If the send mechanism is performed in
    application schedule context (compared to sending on Tx interrupt), the ECU needs to poll
    the send function more often, and thus less time will be spent on the applications normal
    functionality.

description: >
    When in non-programming session, the ECU shall be able to send Consecutive Frames with N_Cs
    less than 20ms.
    Note:
    a. If other CAN frames with higher priority exist on CAN, then a FC N_PDU may be delayed due to
    CAN protocol arbitration. The requirement is applicable and verifiable only when no such frame
    exist.
    b. For a client side of a gateway sending parallel requests, the CAN frames will have different
    CAN identifiers and hence different priority, and actual N_Cs may be higher than the
    requirement, this is expected.
    c. For a server, if other servers are sending responses in parallel then a FC N_PDU may be
    delayed due to CAN protocol arbitration, this is expected.
    d. The Autosar CAN Transport Layer configuration parameter CanTpNcs is not configuring the N_Cs
    performance defined by ISO-15765 although it is stated to be a performance configuration
    parameter. Instead CanTpNcs is configuring an internal timeout of getting data to be placed in
    the next Consecutive Frame. I.e. if no data can be retrieved internally for sending in a new
    Consecutive Frame, the sender will abort the transmission after CanTpNcs elapsed.
