title: Start of P2Server for queued request in programming session
purpose: >
    To reduce latency when the server shall start process the queued request.

description: >
    In programming session, the server shall start the P2Server timer for the queued request once
    the final response (indicated via Server T_Data.con) of the previous request is transmitted.

    If the queued request is not completely received at the server when the final response of the
    previous request is transmitted (e.g. the message is halted or a large queued request is
    received) shall the server start the P2Server timer when the complete queued message is
    received (indicated via Server T_Data.ind).

details: >
    Verify P2Server timer has started for the queued request once the final response of the previous
    request is transmitted in programming session.
