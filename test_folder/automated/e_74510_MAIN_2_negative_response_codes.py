reqprod: 74510
version: 2
title: Negative response code other than generalReject (0x10) and  busyRepeatRequest (0x21).

purpose: >
    Standardize the negative response codes that an ECU may send to make it easier to understand
    why a ECU rejects a diagnostic service request.

description: >
    Rationale:
        The ECU will implement negative response codes that are specified
        in ISO 14229-1 according to their definition and NRC handling sequence.

    Req:
        Negative response code (other than generalReject (0x10) and
        busyRepeatRequest (0x21)) sent by negative responses on diagnostic
        services requests is allowed as specified by ISO 14229-1 unless
        otherwise is specified by this document.

details: >
    Implicitly tested script
    Tested implicitly by REQPROD 76172 which verifies a negative response in programming session.
