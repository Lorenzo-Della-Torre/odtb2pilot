title: N_Ar timeout in programming session
purpose: >
    From a system perspective it is important that both sender and receiver side times out
    roughly the same time. The timeout value shall be high enough to not be affected by
    situations like occasional high busloads and low enough to get a user friendly system if for
    example an ECU is not connected.

description: >
    N_Ar timeout value shall be 1000ms in programming session.

details: >
    Verify N_Ar timeout value is 1000ms
    Steps:
        1. Request EDA0 DID with FC delay greater than and less than 1000ms and verify response
           in PBL session
        2. Request EDA0 DID with FC delay greater than and less than 1000ms and verify response
           in SBL session
