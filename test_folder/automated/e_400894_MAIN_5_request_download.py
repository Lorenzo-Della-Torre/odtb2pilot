title: Request Download - restrictions on number of addressed logical blocks
purpose: >
    To enable verification of each logical block independently by only allowing that a single
    logical block is being updated (active) at a given time. The purpose is also to inform the
    diagnostic client directly when the software download sequence will fail, as well as support
    diagnostic client fault-handling and retry strategies.

description: >
    The ECU shall check that only one logical block is being updated for a single downloaded
    software part, i.e. one logical block is allowed to be addressed from a valid RequestDownload
    to a CheckMemory request is detected. If any memory outside that first logical block is
    addressed by a RequestDownload request(s), e.g. a second logical block or some location not
    defined by the ESS at all, the ECU shall abort the RequestDownload and inform the client via a
    NRC.

    As the processed length (compressed/encrypted) length is used as memorySize parameter of the
    RequestDownload request, there are scenarios when it is not possible to detect this at the
    RequestDownload stage but identified later when the data is uncompressed/decrypted and about
    to be written to the memory. Anyhow, the download shall be aborted when it is detected.

    To be able to recover when download sequence is aborted, for example trying download the same
    software part once again or continue downloading the next software part (another logical block),
    the ECU shall upon a rejected request enter a state where no logical block is active and wait
    for next request to erase or program the memory.

details: >
    Verify restrictions on number of addressed logical blocks
    Steps:
        1. Request block download for 1st logical block
        2. Verify NRC-31(requestOfOutRange) in RequestDownload(0x34) for 2nd logical block
        3. Check complete and compatibility
