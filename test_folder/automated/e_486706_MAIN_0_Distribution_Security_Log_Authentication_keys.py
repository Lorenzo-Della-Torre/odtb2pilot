title: Distribution of the Security Log Authentication keys to ECU suppliers
purpose:
    The OEM must be in control of the key applied and for separation of keys
    used during development and production

description:
    The security log authentication key shall be provided by the OEM,
    i.e. the ECU supplier must not choose these.
    This is applicable for key(s) used during both development and production.
    Unless others are agreed, the initial key value shall be "0x000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F"
    for which CRC16-CCITT checksum will be 0x3B37.
    Note.
    Development keys are by default generated in Global Master Reference Database and exported to
    ECU supplier. The keys, initial keys, for ECUs intented for "production" shall be implemented at
    latest prior to "vehicle prototype build" unless others are agreed for the project. This is the
    latest milestone to change initial keys.

details:
    Reading the status from (D0C7) as the checksum cannot be read.
    Expect Positive response when the key programed status is 1.
