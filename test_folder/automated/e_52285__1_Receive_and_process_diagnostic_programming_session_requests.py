title: Receive and process diagnostic programming session requests

purpose: >
    To define when the ECU shall be able to receive and process a diagnostic programming
    session request.

description: >
    When the ECU is in programmingSession state, it shall be able to receive and process
    diagnostic programming session requests.

details: >
    verify if ECU shall be able to receive and process diagnostic programming session
    requests when it is in programmingSession state.
    Steps-
    1. Set to programming session
    2. Set to programming session again based on valid response of 0x50
    3. verify ECU is able to process diagnostic programming session request based on
       valid response (0x50)
