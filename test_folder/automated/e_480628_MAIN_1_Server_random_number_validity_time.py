title: Server random_number validity time

purpose: >
    To reduce the possibilities for e.g. off board computations to identify a valid response.
    The expected maximum system delay in a vehicle is known.

description: >
    The active server random number (active seed) provided in serverResponseSeed message
    shall maximum be valid for 5000ms, i.e. the maximum time between serverResponseSeed and
    clientSendKey (server timer) must be less or equal to 5000ms. A clientSendKey received when
    that timer is expired must be rejected and the sequence is required to be restarted by a
    new clientRequestSeed and all random numbers shall be newly generated (fresh).
    Notes-
    Server might be unlocked while last client timer is expired.
    At the client side, the request/response validity time shall be according to the P4Server_max
    response time for the securityAccess service.

details: >
    Validate Security Access response based on given 'server random number validity time', with
    positive and negative response received by server.
    Steps-
    1. Set to programming session mode and Security Access to ECU and return response
    2. Verify if response is valid when Server random number valid time is 5000ms
    3. Verify invalid response (0x7F) and unique Server random number for invalid time of 5100ms
