title: Signing Method SHA256_RSA2048 - Public Key Algorithm
purpose: >
    Define the public key algorithm.

description: >
    The public key algorithm shall be: PKCS #1 v2.2: RSA Cryptography Standard, RSA Laboratories,
    October 27, 2012, where the RSASSA-PSS signature scheme shall be used. The signature scheme
    includes a salt when generating a signature. The salt length shall be set to the same length
    as the underlying hash value. This means that the resulting signature will be different every
    time a file is signed.

details: >
    Implicitly tested script
    Tested implicitly by req-400425 because req covers software download.
