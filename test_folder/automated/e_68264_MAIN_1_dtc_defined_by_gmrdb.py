title:

    DTCs defined by GMRDB

purpose:

    All DTC information shall be supported by VCC tools and must therefore be
    defined in GMRDB.

description:

    Rationale:

    Global Master Reference Data Base (GMRDB) is a part of the central
    diagnostic database that is used by Volvo Car Corporation in order to
    document the implementation of diagnostics in the ECUs. GMRDB is a library
    containing predefined DTCs, DIDs and Control Routines. The definition of
    DTCs (both identifier and description) that are supposed to be used by
    Volvo tools must have its origin in GMRDB. GMRDB holds only the 2-byte base
    DTC.

    Requirement:

    DTCs supported by an ECU shall be implemented in accordance to the
    definition in Global Master Reference Database. Development specific
    implementer specified DTCs are excluded from this requirement.

details:

    We test this requirement by doing negative testing. That is, we attept
    finding one DTC that does not respond appropriately to a snapshot request.
    Appropriately mean that it should not return any error to the request and
    the content of the snapshot should be according the SDDB. Implicitly we
    assume that the information in SDDB corresponds with GMRDB.
