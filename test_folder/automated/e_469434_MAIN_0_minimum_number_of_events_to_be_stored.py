title: Security Event Header, Minimum number of events to be stored.
purpose:
    To be able to analyse the history.

description:
    The ECU must be able to store at least 20 events (for each type defined),
    but 100 events are recommended.
    If both successful- and rejected attempts are reported,
    half of the event records for successful- and rejected attempts respectively must be stored.
    Otherwise, the history of e.g. the rejected attempts could be lost
    (the log is filled with only successful attempts).
    The first half (e.g. 10 when 20 events in total are stored) are reserved for successful attempts
    and the last part is for the rejected attempts.

    Example 1.
    Pre-condition; 19 event records are stored out of total 20 (9 successful, 10 rejected),
    Event record 1; Successful attempt, e.g. a file is verified OK.
    Event record 2; Successful attempt
    Event record 3; Successful attempt
    Event record 4; Successful attempt
    Event record 5; Successful attempt
    Event record 6; Successful attempt
    Event record 7; Successful attempt
    Event record 8; Successful attempt
    Event record 9; Successful attempt
    Event record 10; No history
    Event record 11; Rejected attempt, e.g. the file verification failed.
    Event record 12; Rejected attempt
    Event record 13; Rejected attempt
    Event record 14; Rejected attempt
    Event record 15; Rejected attempt
    Event record 16; Rejected attempt
    Event record 17; Rejected attempt
    Event record 18; Rejected attempt
    Event record 19; Rejected attempt
    Event record 20; Rejected attempt
    If the next reported event is a rejected attempt,
    a record for a successful attempt must not be overwritten but a record
    (oldest) for a rejected attempt shall be overwritten according to the overwrite strategy.
    Note.
    The number of events that is stored must be balanced with respect to the available memory.

details:
    It is verified that the logs for all event types contain at least 20 events.
    This is done by reading all related dids and verifying that they have at least
    20 events of one kind or at least 10 successful and 10 rejected events
