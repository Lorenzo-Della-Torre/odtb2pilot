title: Erase Identifier - restrictions
purpose: >
    To ensure that a complete logical block is erased is required for several purposes:
        (1) To ensure that all information about validity status is always erased (if part of the
    logical block). Otherwise, implicitly knowledge of the bootloader implementation is required
    to ensure that it is erased.
        (2) No unknown data is stored in the addressed logical block, i.e. previously installed
    data deleted ("uninstalled).
        (3) It will also enable simplified off-board review of the logical block definitions, by
    checking that the erase identifier is identical to the expected logical block.

description: >
    The erase identifier range(s) of the software part header must match a valid logical block.
    The ECU shall at an eraseMemory request verify that the erase startAddress and Length matches
    a logical block range, otherwise the ECU shall abort the request. If the eraseMemory request
    is valid, the ECU must ensure that the complete memory for the addressed logical block is
    erased.

details: >
    Verify negative response with NRC-31 for RoutineControlRequestSID (flash erase) with wrong
    length and wrong start address.
