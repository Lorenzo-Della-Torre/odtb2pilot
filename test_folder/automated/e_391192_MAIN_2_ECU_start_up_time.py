title: ECU start up time
purpose: >
    Define a time the ECU is allowed to be unavailable in regards of diagnostic communication
    when powering up and the time shall be short enough to not be a problem for manufacturing
    and aftersales.

description: >
    The ECU shall complete its start-up sequence within 2500 ms after an event that initiates
    a start-up sequence. However, minimum the following events shall initiate a startup sequence:

    1.	Power up (the power supply is connected to the ECU) or waking up from sleep
        (the ECU receives a request to wake up by the operation cycle master).
    2.	An ECU hard reset is triggered.

details: >
    Verify ECU is alive again within less than max-time(2500 ms) by requesting current ECU-mode
