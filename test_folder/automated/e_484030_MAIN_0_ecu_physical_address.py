title: ECU physical address
purpose: >
    To dedicate a physical logical address for the ECU

description: >
    Rationale:
    To make it possible for the tester to send a specific request to a public ECU on a
    network in the vehicle, each public ECU needs to have its own unique address. The allocation
    of the address is a part of the internal architectural work at Volvo Cars.
    Req:
    The ECU shall implement one assigned vehicle unique physical logical address. The address
    shall originate from Volvo Car Corporation.
