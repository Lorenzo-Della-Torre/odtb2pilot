title: Transfer Data (36 hex) service
purpose: >
    There is a requirement to support the complete vehicle to be re-programmed via a CAN
    interface. Since the maximum message length on a CAN based network is limited to 4 kB the
    diagnostic tester needs to reduce the message length if an ECU (server) is responding with
    a maxNumberOfBlockLength larger than the transport protocol is supporting.

description: >
    The TransferData message length of 3842 bytes (0F02 hex) shall be supported independent if the
    parameter maxNumberOfBlockLenght returned in the RequestDownload service is larger.
    Note: The 3842 bytes is calculated from the formula (n*256) + 2 bytes, where n=15 and the 2
    byte will take the SID and block sequence counter.
