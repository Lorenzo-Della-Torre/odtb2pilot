title: N_Bs timeout in non-programming session
purpose: >
    From a system perspective it is important that both sender and receiver side times out roughly
    the same time. The timeout value shall be high enough to not be affected by situations like
    occasional high busloads and low enough to get a user friendly system if for example an ECU
    is not connected.

description: >
    N_Bs timeout value shall be 1000ms in non-programming session.

details: >
    Implicitly tested script
    Tested implicitly by REQPROD 60017 because N_As and N_Bs timeout value shall be 1000ms
    in non-programming session
