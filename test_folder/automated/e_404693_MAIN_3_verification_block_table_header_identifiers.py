title: Verification Block Table Header Identifiers
purpose: >
    Define the required header identifiers required to
    support the applied signing method.
description: >
    The header section of the delivered software part
    must contain the following identifier with respect
    to the verification block table, when a verification
    block table is constructed according to the format in
    "REQPROD 398360 Format of the Verification Block Table".
    Alternative 1 - verification block header identifiers (default configuration)
    verification_block_root_hash: The hash value of the unprocessed verification block table.
    verification_block_start: The start address of the unprocessed verification block table.
    verification_block_length: The length of the unprocessed verification block table.
    Upon Volvo approval, the header section can exclude the verification_block_start and
    verification_block_length identifiers
    Alternative 2 - verification block header identifiers
    verification_block_root_hash
    This might be applied for ECUs where existing installation and verification mechanisms,
    using e.g. ECU specific manifests, are to be reused in the ECU to ensure authenticity
    that is not possible to realize using the Volvo verification block table format
details: >

    in Vbf Header:
        1.verification_block_start
        2.verification_block_length
