title: N_As timeout in programming session
purpose: >
    From a system perspective it is important that both sender and receiver side times out roughly
    the same time. The timeout value shall be high enough to not be affected by situations like
    occasional high busloads and low enough to get a user friendly system if for example an ECU is
    not connected

description: >
    N_As timeout value shall be 1000ms in programming session

details: >
    Software download request in pbl and routine control request in sbl, with flow control delay
    more than timeout(>1000 ms) and less than timeout(<1000 ms)
