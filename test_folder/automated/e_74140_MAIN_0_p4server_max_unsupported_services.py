title:
    P4Server_max for services not supported by the ECU

purpose:
    ECU shall respond swiftly even though service is not supported by the
    ECU since failure to do so may cause problems using functional requests with SPRMB
    bit set.

description:
    The ECU shall use P2Server_max as P4Server_max as timing paramter for negative
    response when receiving requests for diagnostic services not supported by the ECU.

details:
    Implicitly tested by:
        REQPROD 74109 which check all undefined services 0-FF and measures the time
        for each response.
