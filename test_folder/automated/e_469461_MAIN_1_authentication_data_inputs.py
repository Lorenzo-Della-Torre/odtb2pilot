title: Authentication data Inputs
purpose:
    Define the input data to be part of the actual Authentication Data calculation.

description:
    The Authentication Data shall be calculated using
    all stored SecurityEvents and the SecurityEventHeader
    (Authentication Data itself excluded) as input data.
    A single Authentication Data is calculated per event type
    The Authentication Data shall always be appended next to the last
    event record for an event type, big endian.

details:
    Read with one of the Security log event DID D046 and
    Store the response Total number of successful events and Authentication Data
    Create an Event; Security Access ProgrammingSession
    Send ECU back to Default session to check DID D046
    Check the Event has been logged in D046 DID and
    Compare with previously saved response
    Total number of successful events and Authentication Data
    Total number of successful events will be incremented by 1
    Authentication Data will be different as the previously saved Data
