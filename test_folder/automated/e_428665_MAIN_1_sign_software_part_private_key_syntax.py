title: Sign Software Part - Private Key syntax
purpose: >
    Define the key representation for key distribution at
    test & development and for development tool usage.

description: >
    The Private key shall be represented in an unencrypted PKCS #8 PrivateKeyInfo format
    as defined in PKCS #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Standard, RSA Laboratories
    Technical Note Version 1.2, Revised November 1, 1993.

    The PrivateKey part of of the PrivateKeyInfo shall be a represented as an ASN.1 type
    RSAPrivateKey as defined in PKCS #1 v2.2: RSA Cryptography Standard, RSA Laboratories,
    October 27, 2012.

    The Private Key shall be stored using the PEM format (base64 encoded data)
    as defined in RFC1421.

    Implicitly tested script
    Tested implicitly by REQPROD 76696 because the SWDL works with public key to decrypt
    the vbf file, expected the same behavior with private production key.
