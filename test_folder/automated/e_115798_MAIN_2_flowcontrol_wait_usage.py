title: Flowcontrol Wait usage
purpose: >
    Use FC.Wait to halt message reception in appropriate situations.

description: >
    Non-gateway server:
    In programming session, the server may use FC.Wait if it receives a request when it is
    processing a previously received request. In all other situations in all sessions usage
    of FC.Wait is not allowed.

    Gateway ECU:
    The gateway ECU shall use FC.Wait if it receives a message when buffers are not available
    for receiving the complete message. This applies to server side and client side.

    Verify FC-WAIT (31) by looking for fc_wait.txt file in a defined file path
