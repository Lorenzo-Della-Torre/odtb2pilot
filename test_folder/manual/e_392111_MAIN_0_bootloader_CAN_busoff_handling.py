title: bootloader CAN busoff handling
purpose: >
    To increase availablility of the system. Avoid that an ECU gets stuck in bus-off state, or
    exits programming session due to network errors.

description: >
    If hardware support automatic CAN busoff recovery, that recovery mechanism shall be enabled.
    If hardware doesn't support automatic bus-off recovery the bootloader shall check all active
    CAN controllers for bus-off status at maximum 10 ms intervals and if bus-off is detected start
    the bus-off recovery sequence within 10ms.
    This requirement applies to Primary Boot Loader (PBL) and Secondary Boot Loader (SBL).
    Note: If a permanent busoff condition is detected that can not be recovered, and a complete
    and compatible application exist, the S3server timer shall still run and will finally elapse,
    causing and exit of the programming session.


details: >
    Verify automatic CAN busoff recovery in bootloader.
    When in primary bootloader (PBL):
    - short busoff is applied. ECU shall recover and stay in PBL.
    - long busoff is applied. ECU shall recover and switch to default session.
    When in secondary bootloader (SBL):
    - short busoff is applied. ECU shall recover and stay in SBL.
    - long busoff is applied. ECU shall recover and switch to default session.
