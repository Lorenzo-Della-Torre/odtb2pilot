title:   2-byte base DTC definition

reqprod: 481758
version: 0
purpose:
    All DTC information shall be supported by Volvo Cars tools and must
    therefore be defined in GMRDB

description: >

    Rationale:
    A faulty component shall be identified by the base DTC (DTC High Byte and
    DTC Middle Byte, i.e. excluding the FailureTypeByte).
    Each faulty item should have a unique base DTC as long as this improves the
    accuracy of the fault tracing and repair method. The definition and
    structure of a base DTC must be in accordance with SAEJ2012.

    Requirement:
    All parts and components (this includes both external and internal parts)
    monitored by an ECU shall each have a unique (if not specifically stated
    otherwise in other Volvo Car requirements) 2-byte base DTC with the
    following properties:

     * The description of the base DTC shall match the definition of the
       monitored part or component.

     * The structure of the base DTC shall be in accordance with SAEJ2012.

details:

    Tested by inspection. A validation of all defined DTCs in the SDDB can also
    be a method. Hilding or dSpace HIL is not needed for this.
