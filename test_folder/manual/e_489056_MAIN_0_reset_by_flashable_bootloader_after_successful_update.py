title: Reset by flashable bootloader after successful update
purpose: >
    As the Flashable PBL may not be able to communicate with the tester, it needs to reset itself
    after the erase and copy process has finished in order to resume normal operations and enable
    communication to the tester.

description: >
    Reset shall be performed by flashable PBL itself after the successful PBL update.

details: >
    Verify ECU stays in programming session and is able to communicate with tester after
    flash PBL using software download.
    Steps -
    1. Flash PBL using software download.
    2. Verify ECU stays in programming session
    3. Verify ECU is able to communicate with tester
