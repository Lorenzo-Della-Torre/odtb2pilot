title: Security Access key programming at OEM

purpose: >
    Define how to program (update) the security access key(s).

description: >
    The ECU shall be equipped with initial security access key(s) per supported security access
    level when provided to OEM, where the actual keys for production vehicle are programmed using
    the writeDataByIdentifier service. The key(s) shall by default be one-time-programmable with no
    possibility to return to previous key, i.e. the ECU key programing function shall be disabled.
    The belonging security access level must be unlocked in order to perform the write-once
    operation.

    If some use-case requires support for multiple key updates, it shall be documented as an
    approved deviation.

    Example-
    ECU Security access level YY is unlocked
    The key for level YY is programmed, using writeDataByIdentifier
    ECU validates the DID, format, checksum and stores the key if no previously key has been
    programmed.

details: >
    Verify if keys are by default one-time-programmable
    Steps:
    1. Unlock security access level for programming and extended diagnostic session and DIDs
    2. Program the key for respective levels using writeDataByIdentifier and
       verify positive response
    3. Reprogram the key for respective levels using writeDataByIdentifier and
       verify negative response
