title: Event Type - Security Key Updates

purpose: >
    Define general event types that are applicable for many ECUs.
description: >
    The ECU shall implement event type "Security Key Updates" data record with identifier 0xD0C1
    as defined in OEM diagnostic database. Events related to updates in security keys such as
    symmetric keys, asymmetric keys, certificates shall be logged. ECU may implement additional
    Event codes (0x7B-7F, 0x8B-0xFF) if more critical key or certificate update events are
    supported in ECU upon agreement with OEM.

    Event Header: SecurityEventHeaderType 2 shall be applied, i.e. using two counters.
                  Size 32+32 bits.
    Event Records:
    Time. Size 32 bits
    EventCode. As defined in "Table - Security Key Updates Event Code". Size 8 bits.
    AdditionalEventData. As defined in "Table - Security Key Updates Event Code". Size 16 bits.
