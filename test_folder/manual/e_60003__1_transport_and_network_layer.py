title: Transport and Network layer
purpose: >
    Standardise communication to ensure all ECUs uses the same diagnostic communication
    specifications. ISO standard shall be followed as far as possible unless otherwise specified
    to reduce cost and make implementation easier.

description: >
    The transport/network layer shall be compliant to Road vehicles - Diagnostic communication over
    Controller Area Network (DoCAN) - Part 2: Transport protocol and network layer services with the
    restrictions/additions as defined by this document. If there are contradictions between this
    specification, LC : VCC - DoCAN, and Road vehicles - Diagnostic communication over Controller
    Area Network (DoCAN) - Part 2: Transport protocol and network layer services, then this
    specification shall override Road vehicles - Diagnostic communication over Controller Area
    Network (DoCAN) - Part 2: Transport protocol and network layer services.
