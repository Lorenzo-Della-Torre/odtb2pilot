# project:  Hilding testenvironment using SignalBroker
# author:   HWEILER (Hans-Klaus Weiler)
# date:     2020-05-29
# version:  1.0

# Initial version:
# version 1.0:
#   teststep    Common teststeps moved into support for dedicated service
#   pep8        coding is changed to confirm to pep8 (some code left, though)
