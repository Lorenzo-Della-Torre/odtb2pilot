## Unittest

Some of the new support functions have pytest unittest in the bottom of them.
You can execute them as follows:

```shell
  pytest supportfunctions/support_dut.py
  pytest supportfunctions/support_uds.py
```

This is very useful when developing new functionality and also to guard against
regressions. Using test driven development (TDD) can helps us to improve code
structure and to reduce unnecesary coupling.
