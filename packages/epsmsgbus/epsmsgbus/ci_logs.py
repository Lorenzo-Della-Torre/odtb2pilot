Get or Set server repo and path for Cynosure messages

When running CI, there could be three artifactory servers where the zip package comes from: 
It could be ARA, LTS or CI2. The logs and related information from the execution is uploaded to the same
server for future analysis. 

Cynosure messages have fields for logs and url. This information in victoria is very easy to read, and there is an 
hyperlink related to it to download the results from the execution. 

This is a simple interface to save all artifactory related information in order to be accessible  when the fields 
in the message bus needs to be filled in. It is the only way to communicate two independent systems (ci_runner with
Jenkins information and message bus with info about AutomationDesk execution)

In case the server info is not provided (ex. running from HILTest pipeline where is not need to provide a zip package), 
the server will be ci2.
